Open source project creating a juntion to use for internalizing 
Xbox(OG) dongles. The goal was to make something simple, cheap, 
and small. There have been many variations of this that use 
switches, programmed chips, and spliced wires. This design 
removes the need for any of those. Please note that these are 
designed for one internal dongle per port. Stacking multiple 
dongles onto the same port may require a switch or additional 
materials. The materials document lists everything used on the 
PCB, along with it's matching connectors.

The pin positions are identical on the "Mobo" and "Controllers" 
connectors. This requires a cross cable be used from the "Mobo" 
connector to the motherboard. The controllers plug dirctly to the 
junction.

The "Shield" connector is for grounding the shields of 
the controller ports. The ports themselves will need to be 
insulated from the Xbox's metal cage. It is also necessary to 
verify that the connector on the controller itself has been 
grounded. While some aftermarket controllers may already be 
grounded, others will require some solder on the black wire to the
metal shield.

The "Xerc" connector are for those who have a Xerc 2 mod and wish
to internalize a dvd dongle. The wire that would normally bridge 
the two can just be plugged into the marked pin. This is connected
to both dongle positions.

For those unable to view the materials file, a picture is attached below.

Revision 1. 
Dimensions: 55 x 33.5 x 13.4mm. 
The difference between this and beta is a designated spot for the 
diodes. Originally, they would have been soldered across the points. 
This design was changed for complete assembly upon ordering, and an 
attempt to ease the mounting process by including all parts on the 
same side of the pcb.

Revision 2. 
Dimensions: 40 x 35.5 x 13.4mm. 
All the same features as revision 1, just slightly smaller.
